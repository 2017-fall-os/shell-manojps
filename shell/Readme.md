I have implemented first part of the shell lab, and only a small part of the second part. The shell uses the tokenizer developed in lab 1. The shell uses standard memory management library in C and strcat() function from C's string manipulation library. The strcopy() implementation used in the program is borrowed from the code shared by Dr. Freudenthal.

My implementation of the shell can be found inside the `shell` directory.

To compile the program run:
```
make
```
To run the shell use:
```
./shell
```

To clean up the executables, use:
```
make clean
```
